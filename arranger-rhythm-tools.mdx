This guide outlines how to craft rhythm styles in **Reaper** and convert them for popular arranger keyboards such as those from Yamaha, Korg and Roland. The goal is to keep the workflow inside Reaper using Lua or Python scripts.

## 1. Creating Patterns in Reaper

1. Program your drum and accompaniment parts on separate MIDI tracks.
2. Keep each instrument on its own MIDI channel so style converters can map parts correctly.
3. Save short sections like intro, main, fill and ending as individual items or regions.

A simple Lua script can export each region to a temporary MIDI file:

```lua
-- export_regions.lua
local _, num = reaper.CountProjectMarkers(0)
for i = 0, num-1 do
  local retval, isrgn, pos, endpos, name = reaper.EnumProjectMarkers(i)
  if isrgn then
    reaper.Main_OnCommand(40240, 0) -- select region
    reaper.Main_OnCommand(40041, 0) -- export selected MIDI
  end
end
```

Use this script to quickly generate the pieces needed for a style file.

## 2. Converting MIDI to Arranger Formats

After exporting the MIDI sections, you can convert them to the proprietary rhythm formats used by each keyboard. Many open‑source utilities parse MIDI and repackage the data:

- **yamaha_style_maker** – converts separate MIDI parts into `.sty` files for PSR and Tyros.
- **korgtools** – community scripts that build Korg styles (`.sty`) from MIDI patterns.
- **style_dumper** – reads and writes Roland style chunks.

If no ready‑made tool is available, a Python script can assemble the style structure by following manufacturer documentation. The basic steps are:

1. Read the MIDI files and extract note and controller data per channel.
2. Insert this data into the header/layout required by the target keyboard.
3. Save the resulting binary as the appropriate style extension.

```python
# pseudocode for MIDI to style
import mido
# load midi parts, map to style sections
# write header bytes and merge tracks
with open('mysong.sty', 'wb') as out:
    out.write(header_bytes)
    out.write(pattern_data)
```

## 3. Using Styles on Different Keyboards

Because each brand uses a distinct file layout, you might need to maintain multiple export scripts. The workflow generally is:

1. Compose and edit everything in Reaper.
2. Run your conversion script choosing the desired keyboard format.
3. Copy the generated style file to a USB drive and load it in the keyboard.

By automating the export and conversion steps, you can reuse the same MIDI grooves across Yamaha, Korg, Roland or other arrangers without repeating the manual editing.

With these tools, Reaper becomes a central hub for designing custom rhythms and deploying them to any arranger keyboard.
