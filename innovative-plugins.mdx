description: 'Ideas from recent innovative audio plugins and how to emulate them in Reaper'
---

This page highlights some of the most creative audio plugins released in the last
five years and suggests approaches to build **similar tools** using Reaper's
native scripting. The focus is on concepts rather than exact clones so that you
can adapt the techniques for your own workflows.

## 1. AI-Powered Mixing and Mastering

Plugins like **iZotope Neutron 4**, **Oeksound Soothe2** and **Gullfoss** use
advanced analysis to automatically balance frequencies and dynamics. In Reaper
you can script simplified versions by measuring the spectrum and applying
parameter changes via JSFX:

```lua
-- dynamic_eq.lua
local track = reaper.GetSelectedTrack(0, 0)
-- analyze spectrum and adjust ReaEQ bands
```

Combine FFT analysis with envelope followers to smooth harsh resonances or tame
excessive sibilance.

## 2. Smart Reverb and Space Modeling

Recent reverbs such as **FabFilter Pro-R 2** and **SoundTheory Vulcan** offer
adaptive decay and EQ controls. You can mimic these ideas by chaining Reaper's
`ReaVerb` with scripted adjustments to impulse responses and damping settings
based on the material being processed.

## 3. Performance Capture and Randomization

Tools like **XLN Audio XO** and **Audio Damage Quanta 2** organize samples and
introduce subtle randomization. In Reaper, use Lua to build a sample browser that
loads percussion hits or synth patches, then apply random velocity and timing
variations each time they are triggered.

## 4. Modulation Workflows

Modern modulation plugins (e.g., **Cableguys ShaperBox 3**) let you draw custom
LFO shapes to control multiple parameters. Reaper's `Parameter Modulation`
feature combined with JSFX can achieve a similar effect. Create a script that
writes automation envelopes based on user-drawn curves or imported MIDI shapes.

## 5. Realphones Environment Simulator

To ensure your mix translates everywhere, design a JSFX that applies headphone
and speaker profiles inspired by **dSONIQ Realphones**. Measure or approximate EQ
curves for popular models such as KZ in-ears, AKG studio headphones, Samsung
buds, and common smartphone speakers. Include impulse responses of environments
like cars, street parties, theaters in Recife and other Brazilian venues.

```c
desc:EnvSim
slider1:model=0<0,5,1>Profile
@init
models = {
  "KZ-Default",
  "AKG Studio",
  "Samsung Mobile",
  "Car Sedan",
  "Paredao",
  "Teatro Recife"
}
@slider
// load EQ curve or IR for selected model
```

Switch between profiles to audition how your mix sounds on each system—from
compact earbuds to large PA setups in arraiás or autódromos. This approach helps
balance the mix so it translates well in any location.

With these examples, you can explore fresh plugin ideas without leaving Reaper,
building your own tailored tools from recent innovation trends.
