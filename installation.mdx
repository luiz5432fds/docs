This page explains how to obtain these documentation files and integrate the accompanying Reaper scripts.

## 1. Download the Repository

Clone or download the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/youruser/docs.git
```

Or download it as a ZIP and extract to a folder on your computer.

## 2. Copy Scripts to Reaper

1. Open **Reaper** and go to *Options > Show REAPER resource path*.
2. Copy the `Scripts` folder from this repo into that directory.
3. Restart Reaper so it indexes the new scripts.

## 3. Load Templates and Libraries

- Place the `Templates` or `ProjectTemplates` folders (if present) into your Reaper resource path.
- Keep sample libraries in any location and update the file paths in the scripts accordingly.

## 4. Running the Documentation Locally

Install the Mintlify CLI and run `mintlify dev` in this folder to view the docs offline:

```bash
npm install -g mintlify
mintlify dev
```

While the server is running you can access the docs from within Reaper using **Help âžœ Open web browser** and pointing it to `http://localhost:3000`. This keeps the documentation one click away.

## 5. Packaging Everything

To create a portable package, compress the documentation and scripts:

```bash
tar -czf reaper-tools.tar.gz docs/ Scripts/ Templates/
```

Share this archive with other users. They can extract it and follow the steps above to install.
